This is an ever expanding collection of useful gliding tools made to practice coding.


<h3>Glide range calculator</h3>

This is a very simple site for calculating glide range.

It uses height and glide ratio along with an optional entry for rate of sink to calculate how long until you reach the ground.

It also calculates how many feet will be lost for every Km travelled.



<h3>Silver launch height calculator</h3>

Under BGA rules the launch height cannot be more than 1% of the claimed flight distance.

This tool calculates how high your maximum launch height can be and also takes into account the height distance between two airfields.
