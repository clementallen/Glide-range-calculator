### Glide range calculator

This is a very simple tool for calculating glide range.

It uses height and glide ratio along with an optional entry for rate of sink to calculate how long until you reach the ground.

It also calculates how many feet will be lost for every Km travelled.


### Silver launch height calculator

Under BGA rules the launch height cannot be more than 1% of the claimed flight distance.

This tool calculates how high your maximum launch height can be and also takes into account the height distance between two airfields.


### Handicapped speed calculator

Calculates your handicapped speed by entering your speed and glider handicap.


### BGA handicaps list

List of bga handicaps displayed in a nice responsive list
